# eAtlas Â· [![Node CI](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22)
#### This README is for branch `spenser`

The `eAtlas` project itself has a different README.

### SPENSER

For development and production config/instructions see the "master" branch.

This branch is built over at hub.docker.com/layik:spenser

It is also pulled form our server on www.geospenser.com

## Deployment Pipeline
The production server has an instance of `watchtower` container which watches changes on the hub.docker.com image. It automatically restarts the `spenser` container running. 

The data is released on this repo's `dataset` release. Therefore, once the data is updated and a new push is sent to this repo which of course starts a new build on hub.docker.com, the production instance(s) pull(s) the update.

## Development
It would be wise to use the official npm package of eAtlas had it not been for the necessary subsetting of the data on remote server. This requires a custom fork/branch and hence this fork. To develop this branch, all development docs on the master/main branch applies. There is no structual change in terms of stack or the application being a geoplumber app.

## Data workflows
The original output comes from the SPENSER microsimulation which generates CSV files for each geography. Processing this output is done via a separate repo under `layik/spenser` private repo. 

## News/changes

* ~Feb/March 2021 dump population data under 2018. See private repo for details.~
