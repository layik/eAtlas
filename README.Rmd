The The Turing Geovisualisation Engine (TGVE or eAtlas) is a web-based, interactive visual analytics tool for geospatial data analysis, built using R & React. The visual views and interaction mechanisms designed into the tool is underpinned by empirically-informed guidelines around visualization design and techniques from Geographic Information Science (GIScience). 

There are some [notes](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/blob/master/notes/project_planning.md) to read. These are thoughts and background reading material as we take steps towards understanding what an "interdependent" eAtlas might be. Would it be "Turing Geovisualization Engine"?

## Using eAtlas

### npm package
Current release is in beta for testing of the limited functionality and API offered by the codebase. Just like this source code, for now the package is released under `layik`'s account. 

### Github Template repo
Please see the [guide document](https://github.com/layik/eAtlas/blob/master/notes/guide.md) for details of how to host your own eAtlas using Github Pages.

### Development
To run the front end only without needs for the backend, having cloned the repo:

```{js}
npm i # or yarn
# and run
npm start
```

The frontend is a [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) (CRA) so all the standard commands of CRA appliees.

### R 
The whole application is a [geopumber](https://github.com/ATFutures/geoplumber) app. That means it is an R powered backend API (think Flask in Python) and a ReactJS front end.

To build the frontend, from an R console:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_build()
```

Before you run the app:

* you will need some preprocessed data, an RDS called "ac_joined_wy_2009-2017.Rds".

* you will need a Mapbox API key (will see if we can remove this) in `.env.local` file using variable name:
`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'API_KEY'`

* in production its better to change the `PRD_URL` in the `Constants.js` file.

Then you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(geoplumber)
gp_plumb()
```

visit `localhost:8000`

or just run the front using (without any data loaded from local server): `npm i & npm start`

### Docker for production

Repo contains Dockerfile for production. This is again WIP. 

```{sh, eval= FALSE}
# Dockerfile manages your npm/React build steps
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN is required but app should run
docker build -t eatlas .
# then bind plumber's default 8000 port to any of your choice
docker run -d -p 8000:8001 --name eatlas eatlas
````
Use your favourite document server (nginx for example) to proxy requets (more later hopefully).

## Funding

The project is led by Dr [Nik Lomax](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1064/dr-nik-lomax) and Dr [Roger Beecham](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography/staff/1003/dr-roger-beecham) and funded by the EPSRC via the Alan Turing Institute AI for Science and Government Programme, Grant/Award Number: EP/T001569/1.
