## Introduction

The TGVE  is a web based interactive visual analytics tool built on modern web stack of technology. The visual views and interaction mechanisms designed into the tool is underpinned by empirically-informed guidelines around visual perception from cognitive science and the information visualization domain. Additionally, techniques from geographic information science (GIScience) and related domains is used to implement techniques for automatic aggregation of temporal and spatial data.
